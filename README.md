# Syntax-Checker

This is a school project created for my Compilers class that uses JFlex to generate a lexical analyzer. This program reads in source code, 
checks for any syntax errors, and outputs an error message describing any syntax errors found.
If no syntax errors are found the program will then update the indentation of the source code.
